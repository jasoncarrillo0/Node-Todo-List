# Node-Todo-List

I created this app using Node, Embedded JavaScript (EJS), Express, and MongoDB. The app is currently deployed at the following url: : https://protected-mesa-72104.herokuapp.com/. I learned to build the app in a bootcamp, and I customized the app to my own style and added functionality, such as the ability to create lists with a custom page, and the ability to delete lists.
